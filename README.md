# printable-paper
Printable sheet patterns, handcoded in postscript

## Currently available designs:
* Graph paper (`graph.ps`)
* Sheet music paper
  * Regular (`music.ps`)
  * Grand staff (`grandstaff.ps`: unified treble and bass row with middle C marked thick in the middle)
* Lattice patterns
  * Triangle lattice (`triangle.ps`)
  * Hexagonal lattice (`hexagonal.ps`; thin kagome overlay, can be toggled by commenting `kagome` at the very end)
  * Kagome lattice (`kagome.ps`; thin hexagonal overlay, can be toggled by commenting `honey` at the very end)

All designs have a number of tuneable parameters (page size, size of pattern elements, etc.), 
these can be adjusted by editing the postscript code. I aimed to make them well visible...
